				As a child I loved watching my father do his work, he was a network specialist and his teachings started my love for technology.
	  I began at a very young age of 9 working with my father on broken computers, virus infected systems, and his most prominent job of all,
	  networking large systems such as schools. Which is where I did my first professional job that involved computers, father and son together
	  on the job networking over 100 computers to a single network. From there my love for computers only grew stronger.
	  My goal is to introduce you to a friendlier side of computers and make them work for you.
